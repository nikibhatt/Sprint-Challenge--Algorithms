#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Time: O(log(n)), Space: O(1)
Time complexity is Log(n) since within the while loop, the n is getting squared. So the iterations is exponentially lesser.
Space complexity is O(1) since its a simple mathematical equation

b) Time: O(n^2), Space: O(1)
Time complexity is N squared because of the nested loops. Even though the J is doubled up and while loop is not running n times, it rounds up to N square.
Space complexity is 1 since its simple mathematical variables, even though there are two of them

c) Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
time complexity is O of n because of recursion.
Space complexity is O of n again because of its stored in memory through the whole recursion stack
